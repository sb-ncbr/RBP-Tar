# RBP-Tar

RBP-Tar is a web server for the retrieval of experimentally derived binding sites for hundreds of RNA Binding Proteins on the human genome. The web-server is running at https://rbp-tar.biodata.ceitec.cz.

## Own installation

### Requirements

RBP-Tar was tested on Ubuntu 24.04 with Python 3.12, Flask 3.0.2, and SQlite 3.45.

### Setup

The application requires the data in the SQLite database file ``genes.db``, which was excluded from the repository due to its size, to be stored in the application directory. This file can be generated by the [tools/init_db.py](tools/init_db.py) script using the result of the [pipeline](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/rbp_encode_eclip) as an input (a file usually named ``rbp_encode_eclip.csv``).

A compressed version of the file (i.e., ``rbp_encode_eclip.csv.gz``) should be put into the [static](static) directory to allow downloading the dataset from the application.
